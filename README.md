### Python-bitcoinlib Scripting Examples

In this repo you will find some basic scripts that utilise Peter Todds python-bitcoinlib and show you how to access the properties of the objects

We have found basic examples hard to find online, so we thought we would make a few to help others to learn

The objects we will be looking at are:

*CBlock, CTransaction, CTxIn, COutPoint, CTxOut*

Contributions to this repo are welcome!
