### Python-bitcoinlib Scripting Examples

In this repo you will find some basic scripts that utilise Peter Todds python-bitcoinlib.

We have found basic examples hard to find online, so we thought we would make a few to help others to learn

First we show how to query the wallet to obtain its balance then how to send coins in 00-send.py

Second we show you how to access the following objects:

*CBlock, CTransaction, CTxIn, COutPoint and CTxOut*
